**📌 Project Overview**

Machine_Learning_Capstone_Project_1 is a collaborative group project focused on applying machine learning techniques to solve a real-world problem. 
This capstone project demonstrates end-to-end ML development from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model building, evaluation, and deployment (optional).
The repository contains all code, documentation, and resources used by the team throughout the project.
The team agreed to work independently up to task three (datapreprocessing), discuss daily and to assign a leader for each ML model, and to discuss based on the leaders model development. Meanwhile, all will be actively participated in all model development techniques.
